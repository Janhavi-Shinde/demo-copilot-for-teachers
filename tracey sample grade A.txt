World Heritage Sites

A World Heritage site is a natural (physical) or cultural (human) place that has special global significance. The site may be significant because of its cultural or historical importance or may be because of its religious value.

Listing World Heritage sites is important because many of the sites need to be looked after because they are ruins or have a chance of being ruined. World Heritage sites are important to a lot of people. Listing new sites brings a lot of people together. Some places also seem to exist if they are not listed. If sites are preserved, they will be able to be visited by future generations.

It is important to list natural and cultural sites because they are all significant in one way or another.

Natural sites are generally important because they are:

Beauty & Landmarks - Great Barrier Reef, Caltan Gardens
Distinctive Landforms - Uluru, Kakadu
Habitats for endangered animal and plant species - Great Barrier Reef
Cultural sites are generally    important because they are:

Historically significant - Great Wall of China, Stonehenge
Architectural or Artistic significance - Leaning Tower of Pisa
Cultural or Religious value - Churches.
